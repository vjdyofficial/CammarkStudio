15 different fonts to choose from! all your **favorite** popular fonts are here! After some Kodular Fenix updates, **Font Typeface Import** from Storage doesn't work anymore. It looks like there is a AppInventor Code that can prevent the label from Importing font file that is not included in assets. which is still working in my Designer App Project. So, no need to send issues about the **custom font from file** because they are actually restricted on it.

- There are 4 grayscale color to choose from.
- Ifyou import the picture, the colors will be generated based on the picture that gets dominant, vibrant and muted colors. 16 colors will be generated but it depends on the color matching.
- You can also set your custom color by clicking the **Eyedrooper** icon on the Color Category. Enter the HEX Code Value or adjust some RGB Parameters.
- Text Color will supposed to be available, but since it actually uses **Android Component** just like photo and video editor does like TikTok, Instagram, VN and Kinemaster, **High Contrast** on the Accessibility system will used on some certain apps. So, this can follow the Black and White Color Text procedure on it. and also, outline will be added. So no need the extra text effects on the app like outline, shadow and text color because these are useless.
